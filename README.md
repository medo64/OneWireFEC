1-Wire Framework Expansion Card
===============================

Non-isolated 1-Wire master.


## Pinout

To connect to this board, one has to use a 3-pin JST XH connector. The following
table represents the pinout, pin 1 being on the left as looking into the
expansion card.

| # | Ref   | Description                     |
|--:|:-----:|---------------------------------|
| 1 | GND   | Ground connection               |
| 2 | DQ    | Data                            |
| 3 | V+    | Positive voltage                |

Output voltage is either 3.3V or 5V at up to 100 mA.


## LEDs

Left LED signals if serial data is received or sent.

Right LED signals if output is active and there is no fault.
